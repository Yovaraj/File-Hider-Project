# File-Hider-Project
File Hider is a Java-based project using MySQL for secure file encryption and storage. It features OTP and email authentication for enhanced security. Users can encrypt files, hide them within the system, and retrieve them only through OTP and email verification, ensuring data confidentiality.
Allocated around 40% of my efforts to implementing encryption algorithms, ensuring that files are securely hidden and protected.
Another 30% of my time was dedicated to developing the OTP generation and email authentication system, which enhances security by verifying user identities before granting access to hidden files. 
The remaining 30% of the project involved integrating MySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring that all user information and file data are managed seamlessly. 
This project not only strengthened my Java skills but also deepened my understanding of security protocols and database management.
